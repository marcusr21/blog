Welcome to my first ever personal blog! I've been working at GoProposal by Sage since March 2022 and before that I've held various Web Developer roles within Government and the finance industry.

By trade, I'm a Senior Backend Developer with a vast experience of building APIs, Integratons as well as designing, architecting and building infastructure.

Through this blog, I'm hoping to share my learnings, stories and insights into the industry.
